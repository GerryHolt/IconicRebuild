<p>We will be utilizing a three-point numbering system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Point 1 (1.#.#) is used for site launches, phases, and site redesigns.</li>
<li>Point 2 (#.1.#) is used for major edits, such as the finalizing of new templates, adding new sections or modules, etc.</li>
<li>Point 3 (#.#.1) is used for minor structure/style/script edits, such as SDS edits, bug fixes, etc.
Each point can go past a single digit of iterations (for instance, the 11th major edit without a site launch would be 0.11.0, and not 1.1.0).</li>
</ul>
